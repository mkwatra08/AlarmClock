The alarm app developed in Android Studio allows users to set and manage multiple alarms. It features a user-friendly interface with a central "Set Alarm" button, which opens a time picker dialog for configuring new alarms. Alarms are displayed in a list with their corresponding times, and users can delete alarms by tapping on them. The app is implemented using Kotlin and utilizes RecyclerView for efficient and dynamic list management.
